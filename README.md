Shuttle Tracker 2014
--------------------

For the past few years I've built the shuttle tracking application used by the SXSW Go mobile app. Every year I try out a new technology or two (last year [it was Ember.js](https://github.com/gati/tracker) and a simple [data transformation pipeline with gevent](https://github.com/gati/python-async-consumer)). 

This year I went for simplicity. For most complex web apps Backbone.js doesn't provide enough structure (in my opinion), but for a relatively straightforward project like this it's perfect. The goal is for a codebase so obvious I'll remember exactly how it works this time next year.

Still a work in progress until the festival.
